    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 ½ cups flour, paprika, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Whisk milk and eggs together in a second shallow bowl until thoroughly combined. Combine cracker crumbs, potato flakes, and remaining ½ cup flour in a third shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Prick pork chops thoroughly with a fork to tenderize; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Gently dredge pork chops in flour mixture to coat; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then press into cracker crumb mixture. Gently toss between your hands to remove any crumbs that haven't stuck.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Lower pork chops carefully into the hot oil; fry until no longer pink in centers and crusts are crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
